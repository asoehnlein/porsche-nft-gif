## About the Project

The 911. A timeless icon turned virtual. A car that broke boundaries and defied convention. A car born out of the relentless pursuit of a dream to pioneer the unknown. Owning one of 2,363 PORSCHΞ 911 NFTs gives you access to a road driven by an exclusive community known as the PIONΞERS CIRCLE. With the recent transition to 3D, the project now offers the creation of 360-degree GIFs for each NFT. Explore the [PORSCHΞ 911 collection on OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/porsche-911), learn more at [www.nft.porsche.com](www.nft.porsche.com), and follow on Twitter [@eth_porsche](https://twitter.com/eth_porsche).
